    <h1>
        what is Artificial Intelligence?</h1>
        <p>
            Artificial defines "man-made," and intelligence defines "thinking power",
            hence Artificial Intelligence means "a man-made thinking power." so we
            can define Artificial Intelligence (AI) as the branch of computer science
            by which we can create intelligent machines which can behave like a human.
            Artificial Intelligence exists when a machine can have human-based skills
            such as learning, reasoning, and solving problems with Artificial Intelligence
            you do not need to preprogram a machine to do some work, despite that you can
            create a machine with programmed algorithms which can work with own intelligence.
          
              AI deals with the area of developing computing systems that are capable of
             performing tasks that humans are very good at, for example recognizing objects
              recognizing and making sense of speech, and decision making in a constrained environment.</p>
        
            <h2>Goals of Artificial Intelligence </h2>
            <p>The overall research goal of artificial intelligence is to create technology that allows
                computers and machines to function in an intelligent manner. The general problem
                of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken down into sub-problems.
                These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent 
                system to display.In early days Artificial intelligence was used to develop reasoning.
                With Artificial intelligence knowledge representation has become easy. Knowledge representation
                is representing information that machine or computer can understand. </p>
           
            
            <h3>Advantages of Artificial Intelligence</h3>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence is one of the emerging technologies which tries to simulate
                human reasoning in AI systems.Artificial Intelligence is the ability of a computer program 
                to learn and think. Everything can be considered Artificial intelligence if it involves a
                program doing something that we would normally think would rely on the intelligence of a human.
                The phrase “human error” was born because humans make mistakes from time to time. Computers,
                however, do not make these mistakes if they are programmed properly. With Artificial intelligence, 
                the decisions are taken from the previously gathered information applying a certain set of
                algorithms. So errors are reduced and the chance of reaching accuracy with a greater degree of
                 precision is a possibility.in addition  We can overcome many risky limitations of humans by developing
                 an AI Robot which in turn can do the risky things for us. Let it be going to mars, defuse a
                 bomb, explore the deepest parts of oceans, mining for coal and oil, it can be used effectively in
                  any kind of natural or man-made disasters.</p>
            
         <h4>Disadvantages of Artificial Intelligence</h4>
            <p>The hardware and software requirement of AI is very costly as it requires lots of maintenance to
                meet current world requirements.Even we are making smarter machines with AI, but still they cannot
                work out of the box, as the robot.will only do that work for which they are trained, or programmed.
                With the increment of technology, people are getting more dependent on devices and hence they are
                losing their mental capabilities.As humans are so creative and can imagine some new ideas but still
                AI machines cannot beat this power of human intelligence and cannot be creative and imaginative.
